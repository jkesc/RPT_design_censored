This project is the one i made during my master.
It is meant to design an RPT for an existing powerplant, without changing the current dimensions of the existing runner, i.e. it is a pump with the dimensions of a Francis turbine.

The code was never really meant to be shared, as there exists sensitive information for a powerplant in the code
Due to requests to publish the script anyways, I have gone through it and removed anything that seemed like dimensions or specs for an existing hpp.
I have removed those values from the following files:

DiffuserData.m
DraftTubeAtzeroRadius.m
TurbinDesign2.m
getValues.m
makeGuideVaneCurves.m

I do not remember what those values actually were
If you want to make this project run, i suggest trying to run it, and to fill inn missing information wherever the code throws an error.
